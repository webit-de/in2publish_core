## Publish Files

**Problem**: If an editor deletes a file and uploads a file with same name in the same path,
the publisher shows two entries in the Publish Files module

**Solution**: Rename the file in the stage system, in order to be able to perform the deletion
process. Then publish the renamed file (or rename it again).
